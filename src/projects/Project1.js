          <p>
            I was a member of an Agile team of CS students, where our mission was to develop a web application
            addressing a UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Our chosen SDG was to provide accessible education through a
            'study app' aimed at teaching Key Stage 2 topics to underserved children. This application combined informative
            reading materials with interactive quizzes, fostering learning for those without access to traditional educational
            resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, I took on multiple roles as a software developer, team player, and leader. I actively
            contributed during the ideation phase, advocating for SDG 4 - Quality Education, which our group ultimately
            selected. I played a key role in requirement analysis, creating user stories, and designing features like user
            interfaces, night mode, and progress tracking. As a sprint lead and product owner, I managed tasks, coordinated team
            efforts, and ensured project progress aligned with our goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience allowed me to expand my technical skills by working with React, JavaScript, and collaborative tools
            like GitHub. Beyond technical growth, I enhanced my leadership abilities, adapting to challenges, and fostering
            effective communication within our team. This project has been a transformative journey, equipping me with valuable
            insights into software development, teamwork, and problem-solving that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors.
